excerpt: 'We propose a volatility forecasting method based on functional time series. Asymptotic theory related to the estimation of latent volatility curves via functional principal analysis is formally established, laying a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed forecasting method. And the proposed functional approach fully exploits the rich intraday information and hence leads to more accurate volatility forecasts.'
