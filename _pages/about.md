I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [School of Statistics and Data Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/). My research focuses on **High-frequency Financial Econometrics**, **Functional Time Series**, and **Volatility Forecasting**. I aim to develop interpretable, data-driven methodologies for understanding complex financial dynamics.

Outside of research, I enjoy organizing code and mathematical ideas into clear frameworks, and I'm passionate about building tools that bridge theory and practice.
